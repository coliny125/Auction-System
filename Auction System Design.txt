Auction System

Functionality and Behavior
An electronic (or human) Auctioneer controls the progress of the entire auction
For every item, there will be a 5 minute time limit to bid. This time cannot be extended or shortened. The last minute will be announced second by second. 
The Auctioneer has the authority to ban sellers or kick buyers. 
For every item, bidders who do not have the sufficient funds to pay for the item cannot participate in the round. 
Multiple bidders can match a price and the winner will be chosen via an epic battle of rock paper scissors :)
Buy it now price - higher than start bidding price but for buyers who REALLY want the item, they can directly purchase it. 

User Interaction
Selling
Sellers can list an item on the platform and indicate a base price as well as a Buy it now price. 
The platform takes a 5% cut from the final sale for using the platform. 

Bidding
Start condition:
Bidders must have the equivalent of 10 USD to enter. 
End condition: 
A smart contract is established when a bidder commits the purchase of the auction item. 
The smart contract will automatically execute at the end of the auction; the agreed amount will be deducted from the bidder’s wallet and transferred into the payee’s wallet.
